        <h1>Cloud Learning Projects</h1>
        <p>A collection of bare-bones guides, mostly to remind myself how I set up various cloud projects. All the procedures here are tested and working, but you're encouraged to learn more as you follow along.</p>

        <h2>About These Projects</h2>
        <p>I’m an IT generalist who enjoys tinkering with different cloud tools and services for fun. These guides are not exhaustive tutorials—they're my personal notes on how to set up useful services on a low-cost cloud server.</p>
        <p>As someone who works as a problem solver in IT, I’ve tested all these procedures myself. They’re here as references for myself and for anyone interested in experimenting with cloud servers.</p>

    <section id="setup-details">
        <h2>About This Setup</h2>
        <p>This site is hosted on a <strong>Hetzner Cloud</strong> server, running <strong>Debian 12</strong>, and costing around €5 per month. I’m using a CPX11 instance with 2 vCPUs and 2GB of RAM, which is perfect for small projects and learning purposes.</p>
        <p>I highly recommend Hetzner for anyone looking for reliable and affordable cloud hosting in Europe.</p>

    <section id="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Terje Rutgersen</strong>, an IT generalist who loves experimenting with cloud tools and services. You can reach me for questions or collaboration ideas via <strong>firstname.lastname@gmail.com</strong>. Please note that I've intentionally kept the email format vague to avoid web scrapers—if you'd like to reach out, just replace <strong>firstname</strong> and <strong>lastname</strong> with my actual name.</p>

        <h2>Note for Curious Readers</h2>
        <p>If you're following along, you're smart enough to understand what you're doing. You should always take the time to understand the commands you're entering. That means checking Stack Overflow, reading the official manuals (man pages), or even resorting to asking an LLM (like GPT-4) to explain the concepts behind the commands.</p>
        <p>The goal is to help you learn as you go. These guides will show you what worked for me, but you should dig into the details if you want to get the most out of these tools.</p>
